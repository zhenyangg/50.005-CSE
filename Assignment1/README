**  PURPOSE OF PROGRAM **
*************************

To execute a graph of inter-dependent user programs in parallel

*********************************
**  HOW TO COMPILE THE PROGRAM **
*********************************

(1) In Ubuntu, run Terminal
(2) Change current directory to directory with ptm.c and testproc.txt.
    ptm.c contains the source code for executing the graph of programs,
    taking as input the variables stored in testproc.txt.
(3) Compile program using command "gcc ptm.c -o hello"
(4) Run program using command "./hello"


*****************************
**  WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES **
*****************************

(1) It'll take as input a list of commands in a fixed format (format below),
(2) Save the commands in an array of struct
(3) Execute a graph of inter-dependent user programs in parallel in a systematic
    way by checking which nodes are ready and which nodes are ineligible.
(4) Children nodes have to wait for parent nodes to complete execution
    before they themselves can be executed.
(5) The last node, which doesn't have any child, will terminate the program after
    executing its command.
